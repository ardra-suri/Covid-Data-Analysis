# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data to derive actionable insights and visualize trends using SQL queries. The dataset comprises two main tables: `coviddeaths` and `covidvaccinations`, providing information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations worldwide.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze COVID-19 data to understand the global impact of the pandemic.
- Identify countries with the highest infection rates and death rates.
- Calculate and visualize global death percentages over time.
- Determine the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19.
- Develop interactive dashboards to present key findings using Tableau.

## Queries and Analysis
### 1. Data Verification and Preparation
- Verify data integrity by viewing and examining tables before analysis.
- Preprocess data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### 2. Infection and Mortality Analysis
- Analyze the relationship between total cases and total deaths.
- Calculate the death percentage to assess the severity of the pandemic.
- Identify countries with the highest infection and death rates.

### 3. Population Impact Assessment
- Determine the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19.
- Assess the virus's impact on public health infrastructure and policy decisions.

### 4. Visualization
- Utilize Tableau to create interactive dashboards.
- Visualize COVID-19 trends and patterns for stakeholder understanding.
- Present key findings and insights to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Project Impact
- Enabled targeted resource allocation strategies for combating the pandemic.
- Provided stakeholders with actionable insights to monitor and assess the severity of the pandemic.
- Supported data-driven decision-making in public health policy and infrastructure planning.
- Enhanced stakeholder understanding of COVID-19 trends and patterns through interactive visualizations.

## Getting Started
To replicate this project, follow these steps:
1. **Data**: Obtain the COVID-19 dataset containing `coviddeaths` and `covidvaccinations` tables.
2. **SQL**: Use SQL queries provided in the project to analyze the dataset.
3. **Visualization**: Optionally, use Tableau to create interactive dashboards for visualizing key findings.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL in analyzing and deriving insights from large datasets. By leveraging SQL queries and visualization tools like Tableau, we can gain valuable insights into complex phenomena like the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling informed decision-making and resource allocation.
